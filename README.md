# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement

MIRNet is a specially designed feature extraction convolutional neural network that computes a complementary set of features across multiple spatial scales, while maintaining the original high-resolution features to preserve precise spatial details.

I have trained it on [LOL Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/lol) which contains low light images ready to train image enhancement models.
